GWSkyNet-Multi is a multi-class CNN classifier for gravitational-wave candidate events published by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. This repository contains the published model together with instructions on how to use the classifier. The input is a sky map FITS file from BAYESTAR, which can be found on GraceDB for real gravitational-wave candidates.
